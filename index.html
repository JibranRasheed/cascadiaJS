						The purpose of this talk is two fold. 
						<br/>The first objective is to outline the basic fundamental of animation and how to put it into practice.
						<p>The meta purpose of this talk to to attempt to bridge the gap between developers and designers.</p> 
						<p>How many of you consider yourselves a designer? Developer? Hybrid?</p>
						<p>Designing animations for software has always been a bit decoupled from the implementation.<br/>
						translating that onto web or mobile is always a bit tricky.</p> 
						<p>Developers can also benefit by understanding some of the basic principles behind animation design so they can add in some interesting elements to their interface designs</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Early in Disney's history, they had a bunch of "old men", really young at the time that were looking to explore a new art form</p>

						<p>Disney's desire to devise a way of animating that seemed more 'real' in terms of how things moved, and how that movement might be used to express character and personality.</p>

						<p>Windsor McCay working at disney, came up with a way to create cartoon animations</p>

						<p>Traditional disney animation consisted of the best designers creating a few key animation drawings and then a "inbetweener" would draw in the scenes between. This is where keyframe and tween came to be. </p>

						<p>We use software to be the "inbetweener".</p>
						
						<p>So instead of a human determining tbe direction and speed that this figure flips, we've can use math to actually create very organic and natural animations from one state to the next.</p>

						<h2>Affordance, percieved affordance & signifiers</h2>
					</div>		
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>What does it mean to "feel" right?</p>
						<p>It is very much based in reality and in our interaction with normal object in our daily lives</p>
						<p>Don Noman in "The design of everyday things" talks about affordance</p>
						<p>At a very simple level, an affordance describes the relationship of a person to an object</P> 
						<p>A signifier is a signal that indicates how an object can be used</p>
						<p>Things have understood physical properties which we can intuit to mean certain things. this is affordance.</p>
						<p>In much the same way, user interfaces can naturally lead people to take the correct steps to accomplish their goals.. this is a signifier or perceived affordance: The concept of affordance derives from cognitive psychology and refers to particular characteristics of an object that guide the viewer.
						</p>					
						<p>"a desirable property of a user interface — software which naturally leads people to take the correct steps to accomplish their goals."</p>	
						<p>In the world of design, what matters is:

        1. If the desired controls can be perceived</br>
                A: In an easy to use design, if they can both readily be perceived and interpreted</br>
        2. If the desired actions can be discovered</br>
                B: In an easy to use design, whether standard conventions are obeyed</br>

						<p>Animation has its roots in some very easy math functions.</p>
						<p>Coming up with an easy way to play around with animations can actually be a bit tricky without pulling out Flinto or Adobe Quartz or some bloated framework. </p>						
						<p>I am assuradly not good at math. I can get by, about as well as I can get by in paris with my french. which is to say, i can communicate, i can have some fun, and I can get what I want to get across across. I feel about the same with math and happily have found ways to have fun with it in my coding.</p>

					<h2>The basics of animation: interpolation</h2>

					<pre>valueAtTime = (end - start) * time / duration + start</pre>					
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>One simple formula describes all animation. <p>
						<p>method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.</p>
						<p>Once you understand this, you can manipulate your animation without limit.</p>
						
						<p>It is all based on time. You need to know where you are going to start, where you want to go (change), where you are currently, and what the total duration should be for the animation</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Breaking it down to [0-1]</h2>		
					<pre>valueAtTime = (end - start) * time / duration + start</pre>	
					<p>change = end - start</p>			
					<p>percent complete = time/duration</p>					
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>when making some kind of animation, we know the starting and ending positions, and want to transition between these. All of these can be converted to interpolation from 0 to 1.</p>

						- thinking about things in terms of percent complete
						<p>you are trying to map everything into a point of reference between 0 and 1</p>
						<p>multiply any value between 0 and 1 with another value between 0 and 1, and the result is guaranteed to be between 0 and 1.</p>
						this will then work for everything - you will have your different parameters like position, color, shape, etc but you can map them to a value between 0 to 1
						
						<p>So Interpolation allows you to start talking more generally and easily porting over whatever you need to put motion to into a very easy range of reference.</p>

					<blockquote>"Using a term like nonlinear science is like referring to the bulk of zoology as the study of non-elephant animals."</blockquote>
				</p>
				- Stanislaw Ulam
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>The vast majority of mathematical equations and natural phenomena are nonlinear, with linearity being the exceptional, but important, case.</p>
					nothing in our world actually moves like that<br/>
					- nothing in this world has perfectly maintained speed except in vacuums<br/>
					- we don’t live in vacuums, we live with friction and barriers and drag<br/>
					- we accelerate and decelerate at differing rates<br/>
					- we experience yaw, torque, etc<br/>			

					<p>With Fermi and John Pasta, Ulam studied the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam problem, which became the inspiration for the vast field of Nonlinear Science. He is probably best known for realising that electronic computers made it practical to apply statistical methods to functions without known solutions, and as computers have developed, the Monte Carlo method has become a ubiquitous and standard approach to many problems.</p>

						Introducing time and motion changed everything for me, because what I realized was that it gave you precise control over the emotion you are trying to convey and how an audience will interpret your message.
