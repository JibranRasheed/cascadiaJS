						The purpose of this talk is two fold.

						<p>The meta purpose of this talk to to attempt to bridge the gap between developers and designers.</p> 
						<p>How many of you consider yourselves a designer? Developer? Hybrid?</p>
						<p>Designing animations for software has always been a bit decoupled from the implementation.<br/>
						translating that onto web or mobile is always a bit tricky.</p>

						<p>Early in Disney's history, they had a bunch of "old men", really young at the time that were looking to explore a new art form</p>

						<p>Disney's desire to devise a way of animating that seemed more 'real' in terms of how things moved, and how that movement might be used to express character and personality.</p>

						<p>Windsor McCay working at disney, came up with a way to create cartoon animations</p>

						<p>Traditional disney animation consisted of the best designers creating a few key animation drawings and then a "inbetweener" would draw in the scenes between. This is where keyframe and tween came to be. </p>

						<p>We use software to be the "inbetweener".</p>
						
						<p>So instead of a human determining tbe direction and speed that this figure flips, we've can use math to actually create very organic and natural animations from one state to the next.</p>

					<h2>The basics of animation: <em class="red">interpolation</em></h2>
					<pre style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;">valueAtTime = (end - start) * time / duration + start</pre>			
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>One simple formula describes all animation. <p>
						<p>To make these motions appear realistic, interpolation algorithms have been sought which follow, or approximate real life motion dynamics. This applies to things such as the motion of arms and legs from frame to frame, or the motion of all parts of a face, given the motion of the important, key points of the face. Defining the motion of key strands of hair, spread around an animal, can be made into full fur. Using custom algorithms, motions with unique, unnatural and entertaining visual characteristics can be formed. The color of an object can be defined by key color-locations or frames allowing the computation of smooth color gradients around an object or varying in time. </p>
						
						<p>It is all based on time. You need to know where you are going to start, where you want to go (change), where you are currently, and what the total duration should be for the animation</p>

					<h2>Breaking it down to [0-1]</h2>

					<p><em class="red">Change</em> @ <em class="blue">Percent Complete</em></p>
					<!-- <p>change = end - start</p>			
					<p>percent complete = time/duration</p>					 -->
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>when making some kind of animation, we know the starting and ending positions, and want to transition between these. All of these can be converted to interpolation from 0 to 1.</p>

						- thinking about things in terms of percent complete
						<p>you are trying to map everything into a point of reference between 0 and 1</p>
						<p>multiply any value between 0 and 1 with another value between 0 and 1, and the result is guaranteed to be between 0 and 1.</p>
						this will then work for everything - you will have your different parameters like position, color, shape, etc but you can map them to a value between 0 to 1
						
						<p>So Interpolation allows you to start talking more generally and easily porting over whatever you need to put motion to into a very easy range of reference.</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>The vast majority of mathematical equations and natural phenomena are nonlinear, with linearity being the exceptional, but important, case.</p>					

					<p>With Fermi and John Pasta, Ulam studied the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam problem, which became the inspiration for the vast field of Nonlinear Science. He is probably best known for Monte Carlo method which was based on his realising that electronic computers made it practical to apply statistical methods to functions without known solutions, and as computers have developed, the Monte Carlo method has become a ubiquitous and standard approach to many problems.</p>

						Introducing time and motion changed everything for me, because what I realized was that it gave you precise control over the emotion you are trying to convey and how an audience will interpret your message.

					<h2>Performance</h2>			
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>As far as performance, there is a lot to consider before you can just say CSS is better than JS. 
						CSS gets touted as being more performant because it offloads calculations to a different thread and harnesses the GPU </p>
						<p>JS translate3d or matrix3d.</p>
						<p>specific to Transforms (scale, rotation, translation, and skew) and opacity</p>
						<p>work is in the initial rendering and document layout, css layer won't have to redraw the full canvas. </p>

					<h2>Go forth and <em class="red">animate</em>!</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
